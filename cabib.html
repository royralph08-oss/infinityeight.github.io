    My name is Mohammad Cabib H.RASHED and I was born on November 14 2006 in [Mindanao]I grew up in a simple but happy family that always supports and guides me. Ever since I was young, l've been curious about many things and eager to learn new skills.
      <p style="color:#000000">  I started studying at Elementary School Pinagbuhatan where I met good friends and learned important lessons about discipline and teamwork. Now, I'm studying at Pinagbuhatan High School, and I continue to work hard to reach my dreams.
School life isn't always easy, but I believe that challenges help me become stronger and more patient.
</p>
<p style="color:#000000">   During my free time, I like watching kdrama,playing games, play basketball, listen to music, etc. because it helps me relax and express myself. My dream is to become a Seaman or Engineer so l'm doing my best to prepare for that future.
I may not have achieved much yet, but I'm proud of the person I am becoming. I believe that with faith, effort, and the support of my family, I can achieve my goals and make them proud someday.
