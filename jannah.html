  Hello! My name is Kirstin Jannah Salac. I am 17 years old and was born in Pasig City, Metro Manila. Our family consists of 5, My mom; Jocelyn H. Salac, My dad; Kevin S. Salac, My older brother; Clent Orbil H. Salac, and my youngest sister; Precious Mica H. Salac — I am the middle child. People usually calls me by my surname, Tintin, Jannah, Jang, and Jada — though only a select few calls me "Jada", since it's a name I came up by myself when I was still addicted in playing online games, although years have passed — my closest friends still calls me by it.      </p>
      <p style="color:#000000">  Based on the stories my parents have told me, I was born without a heartbeat and I wasn't even breathing — the mid-wife assisting my mother was about to declare that I was dead, when I suddenly breathe and cried. Growing up, I was a sickly child — my parents often struggles to make ends-meeet because I often get hospitalised, because of my asthma, and a U.T.I.
<p style="color:#000000">   When I was a child, I enjoy playing dolls with my friends — I wasn't allowed to go outside, so my friends instead come over to our house just to play with me. I also used to love to draw when I was a kid, but growing up — I now find it boring and bothersome for some reason. I love reading, and I also love writing, I write novels, fan fictions, poems, and short stories. I also have a passion for singing, and I hate dancing.
<p style="color:#000000">   I am currently in Grade 12, ABM Student at Arellano University - Andres Bonifacio Campus. My favorite subjects in our curriculum is 21st Century Literature and Fundamentals of Accountancy Business Management. The reason I like 21st Century Literature, was because ever since I was a kid, literature have always amazed me — at first, it was mainly because of the words used, since in literary pieces, they contains words with deep meanings — while FABM, 'though I am certainly not good in it, but I am neither bad in this subject. The reason why I chose FABM is because I have always been curious how taxations and accounting works. I want to become an accountant in the near future, that's why I am working hard to hone my skills and to become a great version of myself that my parents and my younger me will be proud of.</p>
