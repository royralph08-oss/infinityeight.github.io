      <p style="color:#000000">
    My name is Raphael Reynoso. I am 17 years old, born in Vigan City, Ilocos Sur. People casually call me Ralph, Reynoso, Rap, Paeng, depending on who I'm talking to. We are a family of four, consisting of my mother, Raquel Reynoso; my Father, Roberto Reynoso; my Sister, Rizzy Anne Reynoso; and me, the eldest son. When I was a child, I enjoyed playing outside with my cousins, playing card games like Pogs and Uno cards. One of my most unforgettable memories growing up was travelling the north of the Philippines, which was full of white-beach sand, blue ocean sky, and full of coconut trees on a road, during summer vacation.
      <p style="color:#000000">   I’m currently studying at AU-AUBC, Pasig City, Grade 12 ABM Students. My Favorite subjects are Media Information Literacy and Entrepreneurship because they both help me grow as a thinker and doer. Entrepreneurship lets me turn ideas into action, while MIL teaches me to understand and use information wisely—skills I know will help me in the future. In my free time, I was reading manhwa’s and manga’s comic’s book, some novels, fanstasy books and also I love watching series and movies one of my favorite movies of all the time is “Meet the Robinsons” where Lewis is a brilliant inventor who meets mysterious stranger named Wilbur Robinson, whisking Lewis away in a time machine and together they team up to track down Bowler Hat Guy in a showdown that ends with an unexpected twist of fate. I also have a talent for writing, but I’m not a good writer. I am writing about my personal issue in my life, and I secretly know how to dance, probably because of the adaptation of some of the K-pop songs that I listened to, especially TWICE. I describe myself as lazy, quiet, and introverted most of the time. Some of my friends know me as lively and full of energy.
</p>
<p style="color:#000000">    Until now, I still can’t decide what I want to become in the future because there are so many options that interest me, and I’m still exploring my passions and talents. I want to choose a path that not only makes me happy but also allows me to grow, help others, and make a meaningful impact. I know it’s okay to take time figuring this out, and I’m confident that with experience and guidance, I will eventually find the right direction for my future. Overall, my life has been filled with challenges and lessons that have helped me grow. I believe that my journey is just beginning, and I am excited for what lies ahead.
