 My name is Ma. Divine Grace B. Pastor, and I am 17 years old. I currently live in Taguig City and study at Arellano University, ABC Campus as an ABM senior high school student. My journey in education started in Tipas-Annex, where I finished my elementary years, and continued at GRPMHS Main during my junior high school. Each stage of my schooling has taught me discipline, responsibility, and the value of hard work.      </p>
      <p>    As a student, I strive to give my best in both academics and personal growth. Choosing the ABM strand has helped me develop my skills in leadership, communication, and business-related subjects, which I believe will be useful for my future goals. I make it a point to stay committed to my studies and to participate in activities that enhance my learning and experiences.

</p>
<p style="color:#000000">    Outside of school, I enjoy doing activities that keep me balanced and happy. I love going to the gym because it helps me stay healthy and active, and I also have a passion for cooking, which allows me to express creativity and patience. These hobbies not only give me joy but also reflect my personality—someone who values growth, discipline, and passion in life.
