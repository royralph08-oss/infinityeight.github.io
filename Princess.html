</p>
<p style="color:#000000">  I like to spend time with my family. In my free time. I also like to having fun with my friends. Sometimes, i become quiet and shy maybe im shy because sometimes i feel im not comfortable with other people.</p>
<p style="color:#000000">   I also have a boyfriend and we have been together for 2 years and 9 months. We are happy whenever we are together. My shyness disappears when i am with him and i can show what i really am. His name ia Paul Edmund, he is kind, and my siblings know him and of course my parents.My favorite food is seafoods, sinigang na pork and sauteed sardines with saute and also i like fast food like bonchon, Chowking or Jollibee. I love cooking, make up, shopping and studying. Finally my goal is to become a successful business woman and in that way i can also help my family because we are not like other people who can buy whatever they want.</p>
